# comments It looks good eecept there is sometext where it is inside the pictures and I talked to her and it seems to be because its not responsive but if you have a bigger screen than mine it looks normal but on my screen the text in packages is messed up and Valet parking is bigger than the other amenities and the overview is a bit bigger than it should be and the reservations is bigger too
